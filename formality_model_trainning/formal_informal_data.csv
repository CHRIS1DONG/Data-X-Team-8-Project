depends on how capable you are  !!,0
"You've got the girl, you don't need the porn.",1
He tells me hE misses me all the time!,1

IM STILL NOT SURE BUT IT WASNT HIM.,1
as many times as their schedule allows,1
"Next someone will want to marry a tree, o",0
the issue here: maybe first change the question.,1

I would want it to be another woman or anything that please ma man,1
every thing except doggy ...what's urs?,1
1) Don't use ur tongue in kissing her.,1
it means they don't want to hurt your feelings because you obviously care more than they do,0
"You can't just keep taking, something has got to give ...",0
"if he is cheating on you, you should find someone else",0

But that doesn't make it right.,0
"Anybody can truly be in love, no matter how old or young they are.",1

Just don't let him pressure you into stuff you do not want.,0
no i hate them i wish theyed all die!!!!,0
DON'T  WASTE YOUR TIME AND VIRGINITY.,0
The person YR looking for is not me.,0

hell yes because if you don't you'll be kicking yourself really REALLY H A R D,0
"why should it matter what color someone is...I thought it was always important, if the person treated you right!!!",1

"(20 year olds are in the prime, so they may be a wee bit wild.)",1
30 - 40 years from now it should taper off.,1
"Maybe if you ignore him once in a while, he might come around.",1

make sure it is very special.,0
"But me personally, I like good and bad guys.",1
Well as a woman I would wonder what is wrong with a guy who didn't like sex.,1
i agree wit that oen answer if u concider them chicks go wait a very long time,1
just say  it plain to him guys are like that,1
He did behind ur back once why wouldn't he do it agoin.,1
A little flirting won;t hurt anybody.,0
"Hey, half the fun of getting pregnant, is the trying part!",1
are you saying that your both marryed or that your gay?,1

People conversate with other people all the time!,1
Now that gay and gay marriage has become law.,0
"u go tell him directly coz no one dies from love,trust me",0
and u'll see for urself what can love do!,1
if your friend really has a problem with them dating then talk to the guy.,1
and you say your young too well if thats the case its kinda suppose to be like that.,1
fall in love then you will know.,0
I get about 7 to 12 a day!!,1
"I just played a song to him, then I told him thats how I felt about him.",1
well  you  should  just  forget that  you are  doing it.,1
not making yourself stick out like a sour thumb.,1
drop hints and let some one else out you and just admitt to it when they ask.,1
Can you imagine how bad would you feel if your husband wants to be best friends with his EX??,0
I didn't find a mature guy until I met someone in their late 20s.,0
I read a lot and am not what you would call attractive at all.,1
DISAPLINE TAKE PRIVLAGES AWAY DONT LET THEM WALK ALL OVER YOU.,1
"Read this book, it will really get you ready for love!!",1
"Dont let him see it coming, though.",0
ever since the break up i havent seen him not crying,0
it's human nature to want what you can't have.,0
when i was 21 i had a girlfriend that was 28 so no i dont think so.,0
"I work in a Junior High School, I can wait.",0
2 years will not matter unless you are really young,1
"If you think he is cheating, he probably is...",0
My bet is most pick Angelina?,0
it depends on the guy...and just how shy the girl is.,0
You don't want anyone ugly either.,0
And make sure she doesn't read any beauty or celebrity magazines!,0
no because if you are only around for the sex where is the relationship?,0
ofcourse he still loves u....it's just that he got mad at u!!!,1
take it easy and everything will fall in to place.,1
i dont think so i mean Women are sensitive  we cant change that,0
and it makes her look hot if she has curves!!,0
"I told the guy I liked, that my friend liked him, but she really doesn't!",0
Take 'em to chuckie cheese or whatever 5 year-olds like now.,1
Hes a jerk you dont just leave a person hanging like that.,0
"if she is a tom boy, take her to a low class diner.",1
uhmmmm how about looking for a job.,1
over-react when you ask him questions with suspicion.,0
What I will tell you is this REAL men are fantastic and are nothing like that.,0
"ok, my best friend and my boy friend are fighting over me.",1
when you can't stop to think about that person,1
"you really can't, i think time will tell",1
"I may be wrong, i dont  know.",0
Mostly because in chat rooms the people don't have to see who they are insulting.,1
ehmmm ...first try to find a japanese girl if you can...  :DD,0
if they don't believe in their own attractiveness.,1
It's probably just boys being boys.,0
START SLOW AND FASTER SLOW THEN FASTER.,0
"but onething, you should see the size of the body also...  major guys doesnt like huge boobs.",0
"if its meant to be, it will be.",1
ask questions ..dont discuss religion..sex..or politics.,0
They want someone who is smart and funny and...!,1
"i dont really know, but maybe you could try being close friends with him.",1
Apparently girls like guys with skills...,0
It really just depends on what both of you are looking for!,0
you shoudl go for someone who will like you for you....:),0
but he has higher standards than that!,1
"will if you give her what she want you know take her out to a movies,restrarant,hotel and you know.......",1
then you just touch her on her cheek and say she's hot and then you gotta be best friends!,1
"Agreed, if you like things the way they are, but want more, just don't push anything.",1
I would just let it go...even though its really annoying...be a friend and listen to it.,1
Dont take him back- even if he was drinking or not.,1
Don't you know the answer to that since your the one married to her.,0
YOU DID RIGHT AND THAT IS CHEATING!,0
"choosing a partner, i have no experience in.",1

"i guess i always had hope we could be together again, now i know we cant.",1
Always tell her how good she smells and how crazy you are for her.,0
"Then, I would ask her for an opportunity to romance her again...dinner, flowers, dancing...etc.",0
"know, so that i can find the guy and break his neck",0
If you dont then i dunno what to tell ya.,0

First off BE HONEST with both of them .,0
why not ask mary or marques?,1
itz ok if ur careful and smart about it.,1
"I don't go out with guys, if there's no spark, no oomph.",0
When you get married it's a serous thing.,1
"The same thing hapened with me, he cheated on me with my BEST FRIEND.",1
"I know it's hard, but try and pity them.",0
What if you two start working on it and she cheats on or leaves you for another man again.,1
"I never met them just talked as friends, was I wrong Im not sure?",0
well i personally love for my man to have a goatee.,0
because they are afraid that it will scare the guy.,1
(you were talking about that kind of balls right?),1
"well how about joiing the army, get stationed there and hang around the german clubs?",1
the way she acts with you !,1
no i don't know what you mean.,1
he says it bothers him too that guys leave me comments.,0
in other words my entire life,1
Maybe ask her to start over and go one another date.,0
Just give it to him straight.,1
just be yourself and dont try to be somebody.,0
u cant control it or search for it.,0
My ex wife said she didn't think it would affect our relationship when she cheated...,1
I know it sucks but sometimes you just need to do this.,0
2. do the two of you have experience in solving disagreements well?,0
Someone told him negative things about u.,0
Now he wants to get married and I love him so much.Should I trust him.,1
there really is no way to justify incest.,0
All the girlfriend is going to do is waste your time and money .,0
"shew is blind, they arent soul mates; he is a liar and a cheater.",0

"Get a puppy, or watch the American Pie movies.",0
Good luck what ever you choose to do with your life!,1
its not just going to be a gift  instead its going to be gifr-for-a-life-time!,1
because guys like boobs and the internet is the easiest place to find them.,1
girl's can't be gay they can be lesbians.,1
be nice and she will come around.,0
"HONEY , YOU NEED SOME SERIOUS A.A.",1
make sure u r gonna be able to understand each other,0
We didn't see each other like yourself but through pictures and cam.,1
love hurts and I will do it again,0
Probably because no one is there to tell them not to.,1
I reply and we go on!,0
What girl could say no to that?,0
especially those sold at hot topics.,1
i like this girl that sits in front of me in hisory.,1
And I'm thinking size does matter!,0
Wow you sound like me...we should chat!!!,0
"i'll call you when i wake up, i promise.",1
the love to see them grow and know u as person!,1
then tell those other people theyre gay and that u love him,1
"YOU ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL GIRL, THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSSED TO GO.",1
"then get a picture of you &him engraved on it, with the date you guys hooked up.",0
take her to a clothes store and ask the assistant for the fatass section,0
you don't need a girlfriend to be happy.....,0
"Think of her sense of humor, want it to be fun?",0
IN MY LAST RELATIONSHIP I WAS CHEATED ON.,1
"It's pretty hard to find the total package, don't care if your a guy or girl.",1
lol......we'll save that for another time as well ;),1
She just may very well just like quickies like she says!,1
"Just be yourself, and have fun!",0
it makes it more affective that way.,1
"Sorry to say this hon, but yes you are an idiot!",0
actually i think that one of the states that start with an 'i' does marriages for gay couples,0
hE COMES TO SEE ME VERY WEEKEND B/C WE ARE STILL YOUNG.,0
If he's not cheating he's doing something bad.,1
"Basicly, one way to tell is if you're flirting with this guy and don't realize it.",1
"like in my case, i dont mind doing laundry, but i HATE folding clothes and hanging them up.",1
"go ahead and do it girl, i did and it was the best thing i ever did.",0
like dress nice or something just tell me,0
you apologize with some flowers and you tell her that you love her!,0
BECAUSE THAT HAVEN'T MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET.,1
Any advice you want to listen to?,0
"C'mon, you know this is the right answer...",1
no thats not nasty but thats not somthing that you want to tell people,1
"if its respectable and mutual, its a beautiful thing.",0
"I think so, 'cause I'm the same way.",1
"I think we all have those days, hang in there, and don't let the bad days get you down!!",1
IT'S NOT AS IF I WOKE UP ONE MORNING & SAID OH I THINK I'LL BE A LESBIAN.,1

Especially if you dont want to have sex.,1
"Like mouth, just lips, just tounge, etc.",1
Tell him that you just snapped and that your sorry.,0
"you should be honest, honesty is very important.",0
I want her back.... and that feeling is not going away.,0
Hetfield said it don't feel good until it hurts Carpe' Diem,0

"A girl , i see , but i don't know , named moonlight !",1
i guess it can be a resterant.,1
you have to make sacrifices for those you love,0
she had taken her panties off.,1
as far as work the female works most of the time so be fair a man can do it,1
Guys do not like to be over-protected (most of them) anyway.,0
People always love talking about themselves even if they act like they don't.,1
I still don't trust him even though he says he loves me,1
Maybe you should ask HIM that... (there is not a handbook or manual for relationships),0
but you should let your mother know!!!,1
"Someone who I can be totally myself, good and bad.",0

"Ohhh, I did go out with him .",0
I see lots of guys anytime I leave my house.,1
but dont make it sounds like your jealous.,1
But they seem to try to use you more.,1
you should be able to answer that quetion ur self,1
But once u start living together u tend 2 see ur partner often so gradually that LOVE declines,0
"yes, i cant see anything wrong about that.",0
it is not all about the sex.,0
so i beleive that u can love someone with out hurt.,1

"in general..white men prefer smaller women..hence the asians they like,too.",0

see if he realy cares about you.,1
if you are going to loose it take a time out from the discussion.,0
or the way that wood make is SOOOOOOO MUCH EASIER is just asking her if shes interested!,0
it means u need to take a visit to the hospital.,1

"No, seriously, guys aren't like women at all, so it's not complicated.",1
"Developing, oh that would be great.",1
And I just can't see myself having the heart to hit her like I mean it.,0
IF HE SAYS YES ASK HIM DOES HE WANT TO GO OUT SOMETIME.,1
"men are just so sex obsesed, they think women are too... no worries, and good luck!",0

"), and sit down and have a nice heart to heart.",0
Why do women lie about cheating?.........,0
Choose the one with bigger boobs.,0
Or a special dinner at a nice restaurant.,1
I don't think I want to know what your really trying to ask here.,1
love is hard because your nervous and shy,0
You find it easier to be friends with guys because other girls see you as competition.,0
And then you're back with them for about 10 minutes and you go 'Oh yeah!,0
you've just got to watch out on which signals u might be sending these guys.,0
and it put a LOT of preassure off of me!,1

"You're not dumb, mind you, he's a predator.",0
They both always had a crush on one another... but nothing ever came of it.,0
if you use sex to find love all you have is a fling.,1
IT'S LIKE I HAVE A BRICK WALL IN FRONT OF MY HEART.,1

And that your friends are ONLY friends!,0
these things make it easier to approch her if u know who she is.,0
u should make being with u fun again like when u guys jus met.,1
You can't force her to do anything.,1
That wouldn't be fair to you.,0

"Ask her if just being friends online or on the phone is ok, as a friend.",0
"If it was my fiancee', Yes!",0
don't if this sounds mean.. but didn't someone talk to you about stuff like that??,1
I was with this girl and we were going to get married.,1
"Would anyone mind telling me what true love is because everytime I think I have it, I don't",0
"guys(not all guys) want it more than  girls because sex is more important to you, sex is your priority.",0
and he has to put me before video games.,1
that depends on who you meet .,0
Helicopter rides over the grandcanyon lots of shows!!!!,1
"lol, he totally wanted to see your bra... sorry, he's just a perv.",1
i not sure myself..i really want to know how myself...,1
people who are not kind and selfish are very ugly,0
i would agree with wat nichole says.,1
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE HAIR HOWEVER I THINK SOME MEN WITH BALD HEADS ARE VERY SEXY,1
works for me on men that are just friends.,0
You don't want tp push them away.,0
"LOVE IS LIKE THIS--ITS NEVER PERFECT,,,",1
and focus on the reason why you broke up..that should tell you if u have a chance..good luck,1
You don't want that for the rest of your life.,0
i dont know what to say to you about the right one.,1
keep the faith baby others are out there and when in doubt just look in the mirror and smile.,0
Probably because you're not growing together!,0
Men are easy and love younger women.,1
run like the wind and don't look back,0
Tell ur husband if she like her frankly Good luck......,0
go to ebay...my friend's mom buys them on there all the time...you can get anything on ebay.,0
We're not that scary you know.,1

I can't believe the monster she turned into.,1
i am divorced w/3 kids he is married w/1.,0

You did'nt mention what the trouble is....... good luck,0

"be kind to yourself and hang in there, it will hurt less and get better.",0
NO ITS NOT TO YOUNG BUT YOU NEED TO BE THINKING IF YOU ARE READY OR NOT.,1
Yes if your son is 21,1
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.,0
Give me the real thing any day.,1

"Sweetie, you will eventually grow up and find that not all guys are stupid and freaks.",1
"she has blond hair,really pretty alot o guys like her but she lives in WV......wth/me!my bff",0
BUT HE HAS ABOUT LOST HIS BUSINESS AND HIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING FINACIALLY .,1
well...do U like this Josh guy enough to sit around and wait for him to do something?,0
it is just that she has breast.,0
SEX TOO IS ONLY PLEASE WHEN IT IS DONE.,1
i like guys.....lol but i am a guy,1
You are not over the relationship with this guy.,0
E-mail me back and tells me how it goes,1
it depends on what he likes,0
"He must do something nice next, and on and on until you see the REAL guy.",1
Be her friend (that is most imporatant) and see where it goes,1
guys always say that they want sex with no strings attached.,0
Most men think it is sexy.,0
but most popular girs have such a messed up life outside of school.,1
Still you need to tell her that his your man not yours.,0
where do you live how old are you?,1
Give her time to make her own mind up.,1
by the way this flirting is not of the physical kind or the answer is NO!!,1
I like when men dress nice.,1
but he still didn't tell me.,1
I thought it was wrong but i wanna know what you think.,0
Even saying somthing in the wrong tone.,1
Try finding THE ONE by trying.,1
and what if your boyfriend findsout how would he feel.,0
i am not sure that bisexual girls and girl on girl kissing becoming more common but it cool though,0
the max (to me) is about 6'2 er so,0
"STOP THE GAMES, LOOK CLOSE THERE'S ONE WAITING TO BE APPROACHED.",0
I just think this is fun to hear about.,0
Chatted with you on Yahoo IM...,0
Tell the guy you have a crush on him.,0
"It's 2006, you don't have to anymore ~*laughs*~",1
flash him some boobie he will notice you then.,1
unless some really weird person asks thm out and they cant say no!!,0
"Until you find him though, have fun with as many men as you find attractive and fun!",0
they got married and she left him for another man.,1
I have not found my true love yet but it is coming!,1
"good q, good ans so far.",0
P.S i think she really did give it back to me still.,0
Nope cause it gives u  a break from everything,1
"Tell this person straight up, that you like them as a friend but it stops there.",1
"hi,i think u should know more about his life.",0
And FYI: Not all guys play games.,1
You could keep it exclusive to close family and friends.,1
Tell her you have a crush on her lol,0
Do you want to get married??,1
It hurt's people sure but that's ok.,1
if so then why would he want you to ask a question like this .,0
"try tickets to an event (sporting, concert, etc.)",0
but it does sound like cheating.,1
i  am  a  fe  male  so  i think  guys  would pretty  females  bcuz  just  becus,1
WAIT until you are BOTH in love or married...wait a minute... how old are you?,0
"I hope everything works out for you guys, just talk about it.",0
"of course they  would want to leave you , they don't sometimes  want children if it ain't theirs!",1
"yes... always be honest, no matter what.",1
skin on the end of his penis should be just fine.,0
I MYSELF WOULD SAY THAT THEY PLAY TOO DAMN MUCH.,0
If you love him and he feels the same then what does it matter how other people feel?,1
it's the only thing that you know is going to happen in your life for sure,1
Start there and she will lead the way to the rest.,1
"Dont let him see it coming, though.",1
So it can work if you want it to!,0
truly kind and caring people aren't as common as it seems.,1
"And yes, guys think they are very sexy.",1
im not gay but i am a bisexual & i want to have other peoples opinion on it.,1
ask her if she is married.,1
if you sacrifice too much of yourself then you wont be you anymore.,1
"I'm in love with my soulmate, confidante and best friend...and the great thing is, she loves me, too!",1
JUST BY YOU ASKING THE QUESTION YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER.,0
"If he really loved you, why would your weight matter?",1
"Yes, and even more if they are beautiful on top of it....",0
And wants a family with me.,0
"ummmm.... i don't think its romantic i thinks its gross, but also farts are funny.",1
I don't see anything wrong with it at all.,1
that is great u still have your flower.,1
"I robbed the craddle, was her high school sweetheart.",0
choose one and hope she dont find out about the other.,0
I married a man 3yrs younger.,0
I met a guy on net.,0
because i have a hard time finding love because im over wiegth please tell me!,0
well i would find another guy and forget about him.,0
make her wher nothing and sleep with you no bra no nothing,1
I dont want to have friends that hate me.,1
get over it theres nothing more a guy hates than a clingy stalker,0
im not sure whether he feels 'good riddance' or whether he still cares for me.,0
thats pretty stupid for someone not to like someone else because of braces!!!,0
And thanks for your great B&W digital photos answer!,0
"I am single, rich, hott (very) and women love me.",1
I am 15. my friend wants me to go to this guys apartment with her.,1
"love isnt hard to find, its just hard to accept.",1
TO ENJOY EVERY DAY WITH A PERSON YOU CAN TRUST AND CONFIDE IN THEM YOUR MOST INNER FEELINGS.,0
Im so tired of him... it;s not even funny.,0
just bite ur lip and say it.,1
"YES, THA FEELING IS MUCH BETTER!!",0
I would said my boyfriend how much I love him and I would save my sister....,1
u might feel queesy and tingly..tat's how i felt,0
"But you shouldn't trust my opinion, i just like lesbians :) lol",1
I WANTED THING'S TO SPICE UP AND TURN ON THE T.V.,1
They do it just as the rest of the people who live in other countries!!,0
I say it cheatin is wrong no mater what reason you have.,0
if she has nice arms she usually will have a nice body,0
i hope it works out for you.,0
And I always thinkg she might find someone better too...,0
Since we are just friends right now.,0
"Because if he WERE interested, do you THINK he would act tired?...Nooooo..",0
look in the phone book PLEASE.,1
i am not married yet peaple,1
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME AND YOU TOGETHER?,1
girrrrrrrrl just as long as its not expired and make sure its a latex condom,1
"If it's ok with her, then fine.",0
Then to add insult to injury you continue to dance with her in the club?!!,0
wait for a lil while before you try to get over them.,1
"Now, you have to have the right tone of voice - VERRRY SARCASTIC!",1
well u have already posted your question and then too asking to us.,0
Thats not on my mind all day every day,1
"yah, u can IM me on luapro77",1
What do you mean by r/n - roommate???,1
90% of my best friends are guys.,0
"We got married 10 1/2 years ago, even though I never proposed!",0
if you don't like her then tell her  it the right  thing to do ;(,1
all normal guys want is a quickie.,0
let em know what happenes k Tiger,1
do NOT get married until u find ur soulmate!!,0
anw njoy your life now cz sometimes love hurts!good luck sweety!,1
the problem is you can't....but if he really cared about you he'd have more than sex on his mind!,1
Or I suppose you could pay like 200rs in front of palakha :P,0
and if you find it hot where do you like them at ?,0
i'm not in the mood or feign being asleep.,1
"if you don't feel so sure about him or you are not comfortable, then dump him",1
Too Big: her love for her hubby Too Small: her tolerance of his ignorance,1
this doesnt mean you cant be friends just that your not dating.,1
you obviously have an obsession with men who cheat... sorry,0
Now think whether it could happen with your ex...,1
"someone who cheated is probably deceptive... they will lie and say they don't know why, when, really, they do",0
"maybe, but I told her up front NO GAMES!",1
wayyy better than a chat room.,0
Oh my goodness it is crazy that you asked that question.,0
It means a lot that people still care.,1
yes i believe in true love.,0
The dude is a control freak.,0
Good Men != Good + Men.,0
"you can't help them, they need to help themselves.",1
If u ignore him long enough he'll go away.,1
Some are fathers and some are not.,1
"well honestly speaking i do not think its love at your age, its just infatuation and curiosity.",1
Some people can just cut loose and ask whatever they want because you don't know who they are.,1
tell her this: make yourself more beautiful.,0
tell her u meant it in a kinda wait-a-go way.,0
hes not the only cute guy in the world!,1
"Just listen to him, trust him, love him.",0
If she is telling you  You are everything to me  DUMP HER!,0
if you don't try you will always wonder what if good luck,1
but when i went out the stuff hit the fan.,0
Guys do it too but i think not as much as females.,1
"Heck yeah we love it, especially if its the one we love doing the rubbing.",0
"a few months later, he did it again..i got over it again.",0
he doesn't want you to bother him,0
"and let me guess, your the right guy???",1
Ditch him you can do better,0
i dont think you can call  being gay a sin but it is nasty and freaky as hell.,0
if so why and if not why?,0
"Don't think another thing about it, hun.",1
"yes means yes, and no means no, right?",0
:)have agreat life every one full of love and happnies,0
It was a very funny dream.,1
"So when I don't get it enough, I go searchin for the boy to give it to me!",1
coz ur d only 1 left in dis group..!,1
Just go up to her and say Hi.,0
I'm getting married on June 2nd so Congrats to us both!!,1
NOT IN MY OPINION BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE LOOK REALY GOOD WITH THERE WEIGHT.,1
SOMEONE WHO WILL BE BY THEIR SIDE NO MATTER WHAT.,0
6 packs are sexier 8 packs make you look like a fruit lol!,1
Mom and Dad just seems to personal to me.,0
i think thats is wht u too should b doing.....listen to ur heart but let ur brains guide u.,1
if their happines means more that your own.,1
"hotness, i look for smarts, and intelligence.",1
I call it the I love you if.,0
Sounds like to me you got a little situation here.,1
you shoulda just said cya; if he really believed that.,0
Ya should not marry if your not 100% sure.,1
maybe try to convince him you want a lot more than just a hook-up.,1
FYI...it only takes 4 to penitrate.,0
like wat is the rule towards that?,0
"(^^,)  choose someone who you think is worth of your love...",0
you will try to be happy!,1
it's not good to hate but it depends on wat he did?,0
consider him as what he is a looser and go next!!,0
because they are insecure dweebs and can't handle a real woman.,0
"She talked to her, and now we're going out!!!",0
(providing you are old enough to date).,0
of course it is just hope that they feal the same about you,0
I find the best way to do it is to just tell them...,0
If I was getting married for the first time???,0
its to hard to explain love!!!,0
"In that case, DROP THEM BOTH!",1
Don't get too down over it.,0
theres somebody 4 both of u guys (girls).,0
one last advice: you have to want it as much as your partner.,1
"I really liked this guy, he's smart, sexy, and really nice.",1
"but figuratively, you should do something she haven't seen yet that will definitely surprise her.",1
I guess I'm going to go to hell when I die.,0
well yes um usually the boys dont want to be younger then the girls.,0
finish the party at 5 pm or so.,0
and the best way to find out is to ask him out.,1
he thinks i'll cheet on him but he wont come out and tell me.,1
"Ask him so many why's and if ur satisfied with his reply, go on what ur decession.",0
"i would say, however, that women are no better.",0
You need to be careful what you are subcommunicating there...   Also are you ok with always paying?,0
Tell her she looks nice and that you love her.,0
Thats the stupidest question I ever heard!,0
"I mean from the attitude I saw, ugh!",0
well u should let them kno the real u good luck,1
what doesnt kill u only makes u stronger yep remember this,1
This works most of the time...,1
"Well, he pays attention to you in ways that other guys don't.",1
because you doing sex with mans,1
Go and have a good time dont worry about them.,1
Why do you ask anyway...enjoy it while you can...its amazing!,0
i can't believe gals can be thhis sceptical.,1
Yes ... and farted too ... but not during the same episode.,0
If u ask at least u will know:),1
bad sex is like bad pizza even when its bad its still pretty good.,1
find a way to make him jelous and then mention that it bothers you.,0
if you think that he should then you do it for him.,0
Ask her to get up and clean the house,1
and by the way just tell him whats the worst that could happen.,1
seems kinda like a dumb question... if she didn't like you why would she let you kiss her?,1
"if you call him then youll seem desparate, and he'll feel like hes a player!",1
"honey i wish i knew, because i am asking myself that same question right now!",1
if anyone has tips on how we can still be friends e mail me at: livinlifeintheoc@yahoo.com,1
Now here is a heads up for how guys think.,0
They fall in love with everyone they have sex with.,1
Nobody will win if you stay with him,1
I just hope it dosent make you not trust all guys because not all guys are like that.,1
It even rained on my wedding day and I wouldn't change that either.,1
you cant win the lottery if ya dont buy a ticket right?,0
I dont think there is any way u can cheat people when u use different names.,0
Why do so many men treat women like garbage?,1
I bet she isn't gonna find anyone else that's gonna be so infatuated.,0
remember that watching porn does not make you a bad person so dont sweat it.,0
DONT TALK TOO MUCH JUST HOLD HER HAND AND GO AHEAD IN ACTION .. MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALONE,1
"(And if she comes up with any other answer, just tell her no!)",1
they want control and the only way they can get it is through u.,0
they love that person and think they can spend the rest of their life with that person.,1
"if u dont love her, turn her down.",0
Make a CD of Love songs from you to her.....,1
"You know, it's just creepy that your looking for a girlfriend in a chat room..what are you?",1
its hard to tell with men am i right?,0
i like the butt i think it is the first thing i look at first,1
"who's telling you, that u should.",0
send it through a good friend of her.,0
love brings light upon your life,1
"I like to touch the butt, and his manly package!!!",1
yeah you want one but are you ready for one?,1
Is that what you really want?,0
"i'm 17, i will be 18 in 2 months.",0
"if no change, it's time to get rid of her",0
is it the right time to have sex or should we wait?,0
the way i get guys is being confident and acting sexy!,1
yes he's just not ready to tell you yet,1
ALSO TRY NOT TO BE FAT,1
if hes never been faithful why waste your time and life.,0
"hmmm, let's see....so many to choose from.",1
Add it up & see if you come up with the same answer ok!!!!,1
so i would say they are.,0
that depends.....on who asked for the date.....the person who asked for a date pays,1
"AS LONG AS YOU ARE LEVEL HEADED ABOUT THIS, IT SHOULD WORK OUT FINE.",0
i need help on how to break it to him,0
"my longest relationship was 7 1/2 years and i'm only 29.  crazy, huh?",0
"Girl,   I would drop his a** so fast its not even funny!",1
"I am, it sounds like ur a nice person who would really care about someone!",0
it's not as scary as it seems.,1
Ask ur wife to get on a webcam.,0
i dont know who that is,0
chat with her 4 a few days n later give her ur phone no.,1
PLAYER To EX- PLAYER True game is just what it sounds like.,1
"I ONLY CAN SPEAK FOR MY SELF,I'M A FUN-LOVING GUY.",1
Wait hold up i thaught the guy was supppose to b asking that question!,1
That would be stabbin your boy in the back.,0
You should be asking a lot of questions.,0
"also, y did you marry him if you guys didnt have anything to talk about?",0
So he'll be dumping her soon.,1
just tell him why you dont like him and be nice but not prepy about it.,0
Most of the gals like guys who do some bad.,1
alot of the time guys dont not like a girl because she looks fat.,0
if a guy isnt ready to say he loves you there is nothing wrong with that.,0
if you slapped him first then he had every right to slap you back !,0
they are the best comfort when you have nobody to spend it with!,0
"that's just my opinion, though, and really i have no idea what he's thinking, so maybe it's quite inaccurate.",0
If he loves you...he'll step up.,1
"Next thing I know, he's kinda got a girlfriend.",0
five minutes sounds kinda wimpy if its a usual time thing and not a quickie with the kids downstairs.,0
soon..if you want..and late if u aren't interested!,0
try something new and if that dont work cheat on him,0
"And even now, I will not insert anything but my hubbys pen-is.",0
she will see what man was always there for her and which one she really loves.,1
"BUT WE HAVE NEVER HAD ONE OF THOSE TALKS, AND I WANT TO HAVE A TALK TO HER.",0
"and why dont u date blacks, what is the deal with pps, pps are funny.",0
"Movies....lotions....food..lol, or props of some kind to kick-start things again.",1
Listen to DONALD D.........HE SOUNDS LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!,1
no cause you two were not going out anymore,0
"yes, its a very strong word if some one belives you when u tell them i love you.",1
Also maybe he has a problem with just that one friend and maybe he really doesnt like her.,0
Or maybe she DOES luve this chick more than U.,1
I think fowers are real nice its not that often a girl gets flowers nowadays.,1
You will give a special gift to your wife on your wedding night!,1
"Hey ya ever in Charlotte, Nc shoot me a email, dinner or coffee my treat.",1
Flowers and candy  chicks dig that stuff dude!,1
"Beyond that, it's freakin' nobody's business!",1
"no, it's not bad at all.",1
that problem is that i like both of them but i talk about the other guy then my boyfd.,1
Maybe she's in love with it.,0
feeling and he has been flirting or wanting to.,0
"Simple rule - if someone wants you to like them, they'd be nice to ya.",1
"Well, if he just FORGOT, that is not a good excuse.",1
it depends on the reason you're flirting...do ya really want him or are ya just teasing?,0
(I know from experience) Men don't know a good thing til it's gone sometimes.,0
how do i get over him?,1
"dude, i'm 21... and i once went out with a chick who was 17.... it's all good.",1
"8th grade is too young to date, baby!",0
"If you really like her, ask her out",0
my ex-boyfriend is friends with the guy i like.,0
maybe he/she looks like a bird house ^_^,0
ull know ull know dont worry and have fun,0
"thats pretty much impossible, id personaly want a really overly sweet boy ;)",0
Im havin trouble with my moms bf.,1
If she wants to just cuddle... then just cuddle... don't get all pushy and horny on her.,0
"if you visit down south again, try to notice what kind of smell it is.",1
"I am now over that, All woman are EVIL!",0
I absolutly dispise my ex-mother inlaw!!!!!,1
i just want her to be happy.,0
I barely know anyone who married the person they were with even at age 20!,1
get a book on marriage and how to make it work and leave it somewhere obvious.,0
"my best friend has a major crush on him,and im only 13-i dont want a boyfriend yet!",0
"If he is not pushing you to have sex, then don't.",0
First of all your already asking the wrong question.,0
And one more thing - don't be surprised after she gets to know you if she asks you out.,1
JUST TALK 2 HER THEN ONCE U START TALKIN ASKHER IF SHE WANTS 2 GO OUT SUMTIME!!,1
if you friend is only 22 she is just starting her life.,0
Should i give him a chance?,0
when a woman loves a man she'll do everything in her power to make that man happy!,1
what the hell are you talking bout?,0
"He's a really nice guy... loved by everyone, a crowd darling I may say.",0
if u guys hook up and it doesnt work out then you'll both  lose a friend.,1
LOVE HIM... for real... don't fake love.,0
"Well, does he really like the girl?",1
"Eloped, didn't have a big thing, and on their 10th yr, had the full ceremony and a reception.",0
yes sure he can but i don't think his wife will be his wife again,1
a taller and more muscular brad pitt?,0
that just makes if worse for every one involved.,1
Over the age of 18 and when you get married!,1
He wants me to kiss him.,0
YEA WHAT THE FIRST PERSON SAID,0
about 1-2 hours a day it depends on how much hw i have,0
"I said No, I do not love you.",0
I don't know!...I just want the points...lol,1
"You shouldn't even have a girlfriend yet -- you should be dating MANY girls, having fun, etc..",0
When you do not have to sneak,1
long enough dont until you know that he is the one for you,0
i think most boys find the internal beauty of a girl at first you know what i mean,0
"Why not, its not like there is a 30 year difference, then it wouldn't be very smart.",0
Give him a love tap on the arm and giggle while asking why he didn't call.,1
it shouldn't piss them off i am a girl and it doesn't piss me off.,1
people that fit have better sex.,1
"make yourself busy, so you would have time tothink of somobody who's not thinking of you the same way.",1
"Cause I got it, but you can't have any!",1
And for the Record men aren't the only scared ones  Sincerly T®ûe Iñš†ïñc†š,1
That doesn't mean I'm out to marry 'em.,0
I don't know EVERYTHING about my wife's past.,1
okay... how much do you still like your ex?,1
Does he have alot of money?,0
1) first the guy is going to notice her body she needs to look SOMEWHAT good.,1
"BUT other than that - you are beautiful and talented, if I may guess - MOVE ON!",1
look her up or just look for her.,1
You can get her in dream...!,0
"Depends upon the man, of course (whether he is her type or not), but sure!",1

SOME women tell lies...SOME men tell lies.,0

your lover boy wants sex and he is looking at a possible seven year prison sentence for statutory rape,0
sneek out and still see him,1
he/she might be the one you are in love with :D!,1
ALOTT -lol maybe thats because my man is deployed overseas and it's been awhile...,1
I personally don't care what the people I date look like (within reason).,0
ohhhh yeah latins are hot and as a lover mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,1
3. is she close and ready to help u through any shituation?,0
i think it weird and i would throw the flower away.,0
"well, tell em, Let em know.",1
well that is jus my opinion but it is what you truly think,1
i dont know him butim guessing.,1
How does an 8 year old go about kissing a boys' thingi?,1
women  had self esteem by being a good mom and wife.,0
"i was so mad at her, but what could i do?",1
well it depends on where you live I guess,1
Be lovable and the rest is up to her,1
"if you like her, this will be tough.",1
but in privacy of home or in a park-let 'er rip!,1
No apparent reason why....just go with the answer...NOPE!,0

"I typically don't stand there and ogle them, but I do look (my hubby is hot).",1
as a guy there is no way you can cheat the nature.when you passed the adolecent age.,0

if youve been together that long chances are mom probably has a good idea.,1
"For example, if you just sit there straight faced then it sends a message that you don't care.",0
You definately don't have to please his every whim to have a happy married life!,1
i would honestly think that the man was a pervert.,0
"Sorry, I dont like hats, instead i like caps :)",1
c if he feels like being with you.,1
u might just like both thats ok,0
nice good luck and dont chicken out.,0
Yes there is a such thing but just have fun,1
But even if you explore your options... it still doesn't mean you're Bi.,0
"if he ignores you like that, he's not worth it.",0
"funny, caring, and good looking, someone who says i'm pretty, not hot.",1
if you are a starving artist...don't spend 300 dollars.,0

Maybe if you knew how he broke up with his daughters mother.,1
"Its not because guys don't care, it's because women want more.",1

I hate the whole demanding diva routine!,1
ok : get satisfaction on your own) and then try to think about her.,0
cause it's one way of being honest to him no matter what.,1
Most of the guys I have dated really didn't care about my emotions or anything like that.,1
that's jus a little advice to help ya.,1
"Oh, but wait, you already gave it up to that guy....what was his name...back in high school?",1
"Im 25, my ex is 28 and the other guy is 22.",0
Don't force yourself to try it.,1
don't mess up your life with him girl!,1
Sit down and watch it with him.,1
Just because it's a guy doesn't mean he isn't afraid to.,1
Dump him you dont want it happening again.,1
BECAUSE THAT HAVEN'T MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET.,1
or maybe he's looking at gay porn and doesn't want you to know.,0
"Come on, vote on the question already!",0
I probably dream about sex about 4 times a week.,0
then out of the blue some chick is going to wake up and realize d@mn!,0
"hug him with his waist ,put your lips on his lips /cheek.",1
If ur pimpin..... she's probably cheatin,1
give them a diamond or do it every night,0

"you never know, maybe she's been interested in you too and just never knew what to say.",0
"be honest and forward dont beat around the bush, it will only make it worse",0

"if not, tips would be helpful(i do know some hot girls already).",1

I NOW THAT SOME POEPLE THINK I'M WRONG BUT I TELL IT LIKE IT IS.,0

"YES, THA FEELING IS MUCH BETTER!!",1
i would take a step back and look at which person makes me happier and why.,0
As for when to take it off... never!,0
I know how you feel... Good luck girl,0
I really need help guys and girls,0
"But if you really want him to like you, you should hang out with him.",0
why would he break up with you on valentines day?,0
"Then she said- I had the best time, thanks!",0
its good to smile shows ur confidence.,1
"If you are creative, just make out little coupons with ideas like: One Free Date.",1
its easy to say but to feel it is amazing.,0
WHATS THE REASON WHY YOUR FRIENDS DONT LIKE HIM?,1
BBW or a large girl or woman doesn't mean that their not healthy.,0
it will be very hard to get over the guy when you are still friends with him.,1
just be yourself and dont worry .,0
or maybe then ask yourself; 1. why does my husband wants a mistress?,1
"And if you don't want to have sex with him, why would you think about marrying him?",0
Well it seems that your doing everything right so far.,1
Come on.....everybody has at least one insane one.,1
that is what my book says,0
"he really liked me, so i pretended to like him, and we dated!",1
"Of course, I've also seen brilliant women who are stump dumb about men, so go figure!",0
(get out of the house) That too!,1
because you're a baby and can't get over it.,0

Girls don't just see money or looks.,1
ask her out and make a move,1

If she is the blunt type then you should ask her and not beat around the bush,0

if she really want you then it's not matter u are over weight or not......,0
Dont let other people tell you who to hang out with and who not to.,1

I love her very much and I would do ANYthing for her.,1

"If he says no, ask another guy.",1
hope u  find a good one,1
I dont think its harmful at all.,1
"And once we do, we're no fun anymore!",1
"my g/f dosent know if she loves me or not, why dose she say this?",0
If not then you should ask him if he likes the company u keep..,1
i hope that answers ur question.,1
no it isn't and yes she can if she wants to,1
You take the L out of Lover and its OVER!,0
I never got to tell him exactly how I felt.,0
Because such women themselves are losers!,0

This man was not my first and i was not his first.,0
my friend boyfriend dump her last week and she is recoving from the breakup.,1
Are you freaking serious with this question...,0
"And then you roll your eyes and sigh and say, nothing, and storm off into the kitchen.",1
My boyfriend and I just don't have much fun.,1

yOU WOULD SURE KNOW IF YOU HAD IT ON BACKWARDS OR UPSIDE DOWN.I GUESS,0

"BTW, begging for ladies on the internet makes you look oh so slightly pathetic....",1

Remember: Men are from Mars women are from Venus,0
So anyways this guy tried kissing me.,0
Same to you and your family and friends... ;),1
knowing you can spend the rest of your life devoted to that one person.,1
"Start flirting, and be in control of every step u take ahead in this process...Best of luck!",1
you can never be to young to be inlove enjoy it,0
"... now, he is my boyfriend of 1 year and 3 months.",0
Or ask when it's a good time,1
keep in mind where you're going and what the weather is like.,0
i would have had enough of him tell me or else!,0
Try to become a dream prince first....because when u find her she would be desiring the same.,1
you have to be able to look the other person in the eye at least...,0
you should ask yourself if he loves you so much why isn't he leaving?,1
first of all...how is he considered your boyfriend?,1
but as for the guy wait.,1
I say that you dress up like Hilary Duff and kick his ass.,1
Or maybe Match.com or something similar.,1
should i just wait...or move out alone?,0

Kinda shy about asking but really want see who else is looking for some fun.,0
"Brother, uncle, grandfather, good male friend...",0

"theres still a little spark, but not so bright anymore.",1
if so it could get kinda strange,0
Ya need to get to your gyno.,1
Get your nails done or something.,0
sweet talk and get them drunk,1
I sorry i didn't tell him what i truely felt for him.,0
even though i took alot of girls virginity away it still took some good makin to do it.,1
"Drop that loser, and get with a real man!!!",0
"Also, does he get a lot of hangups at home?",0
But I don't think I have really ever been in love with someone.,1
"i don't think so, unless you eat twinkies while you are doing it.",1
if she does then she cant sleep with other man.,0
yeah because parents like 2 screw ppl up,0
"But, my God, what a coach she was!",0

I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR EVEN THE SEXIEST MEN.,0
They both always had a crush on one another... but nothing ever came of it.,1
I told him i didn't like that and I wanted to kiss him but with no tongue.,1
hed probably be thrilled... unless the 3 person was a guy,1
Ok wait heres another one go get her.,1
would you straight up tell her that you like the appearence of another female?,0
yes what were you thinking  o my god,1
"if he is telling you he dosent like you , suggest some time apart.",1
"also, y did you marry him if you guys didnt have anything to talk about?",1
go for it... yo dont have anything to lose,0
first u should apolojyse than at lease get 2 know each other.,0
"It goes back to Do as I say, not as I do.",0
so no its not right for him to be doing that.,0
if you are both still young i would say longer...,1
"beutiful body, good eyes,face,slim but hot body, some naughty movements",1
"because millions of other people have the same question ,,,,",1
"it's life, you have to take a chance.",1
ask to be the best man.,0
"Start checking out other guys, let him know how it feels.",0
If she did then she wouldn't be my girlfriend!,0
"If he is someone that you trust, why not?",1
when it comes to family the women have that.,0
"try club love in D.C...and do what u gotta do man, ur liek what...30?",1
because he is scared of commitment,0
"Yea, I now it is bad, but I am in love with Chris.",1

if he doesnt feel the same way about u he wont ignore u. it won ruin the friendship.,1
im single and the only guys in my school that like me are all real jerks.,0
i'm interested in a nice guy with some sort of decency!!!!,1
If you love him that much then stay with him and forget about marriage.,0
U should move on cause u wouldn;t wanna hurt ur friend.,0
same thing happened to me 12 yrs ago!!!,1
"Then go back to being funny, stern, enigmatic.",1
but i wouldnt want to have to wait,1
so maybe you should try to talk to your boyfriend.,0
you have to ask your self do i deserve better than this.,0
whenever you think the time is right,1
But he is getting married this month.,1
But if its a play flirt or a wierd out look she has or something she probably doesn't.,0
its the inconsiderate and egotistical men that couldnt care less about anyone but themselves.,1
Nice girls do want nice guys.,0
i thnik they can be good friends  your boyfriend is just being  controling,1
haaaaaaahahahahahahaha  I bet I know what YOU'RE doin right now....,0
"Nah, dump him, or he'll keep on oing it...",1
(if you push yourself on her you`ll most likely run her off.),1
Like  I have a problem..........or I'm upset that.....& don't interupt until the other person is finished...It works.. try it,0
U have to try practically.....asking out here in Answers will not help.,0
"god luck, i hope shes ok.",1
Most people don't have the maturity to pick someone out for life at a young age.,1
Also remember that the wife is always right!,1

you shouldn't let him cnotrol you.,1
if hes cheating and your cheating its not worth it.,0
can be able to catch someone's attention,0
(not to be confused with dependant on him to support you!),0
pick the one u wood regret not being able to c the most.,0
Trying to ask for stuff on the net!,0
You'll know right away if this is gonna click.,1

But sont be toooo quick to rush it,1
"He shouldn't but he is, and ya have to deal with that.",0
imagine the boobs when the woman is in her seventies.,0
No way not in that situation......my advice is to go on with your life and find someone closer.,1

I hope you get caught on asking that question...,1
H E L L O :),1
i had a friend swoop in on my ex the night we broke up.,0
"Remember who you married, and not the things that aren not important (like leaving the seat up, etc.)",1
Probably he was makin' both of you.,0
just get near him and be agressive and figure out what is wrong with him.,0
Girls: I want him 2 hint it but then i would go and tell him.,1
"just go with what you've pictured in your mind, i'm sure she'll love it!",0
"Is it in their name, or his?",1
because most people are having sex more often than they travel,1
there are lot of people feel ok even to exchange partners,0
if you are able to do that .,1
I have an 18 months old..so i know!!,0
Well if he allways stares at you alot there's a start.,1

"SOMEONE WHO WILL LOVE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE, NOT CRITISIZE THEIR LOOKS OR ANYTHING ELSE.",0

But if she will start justifying then?,0
"show him that your more fun than pool, or join in with him unless its not yur thing.",0

She knew my ex was married.,0
LET'S SEE UMMMMMMM THIS IS A HARD 1 I BELIEVE BOTH BECUZ  I CAN'T PICK SIDES,0

Now I'm with a person I totally trust and I couldn't be happier and the ex is happier too.,1
IF THAT DONT STOP HER THEN IT'S TIME TO KICK HER A$$.,0
A GOOD GUIDE LINE OF RULES MUST BE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE NO PARTNER STEPS ACROSS THE LINE.,1

"i dont know of a site, but that is bc i like to see it myself.",0
"Everything about them, I personally like and prefer the waist, stomach and the behind goodness... oh!",0
If you'r bestfriend likes you and asks you out you should atcept!,0

"Some guys like smaller girls, some like bigger ones.",0

but it wasn't a date .,1
"Are you old enough to have sex?, No I don't think so",0
